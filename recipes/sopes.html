        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p> This Mexican appetizer is a hit at any party. You can substitute warm broth for the warm water if desired. Serve with a variety of toppings such as beans, cheese, and meat.</p>
        <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups masa harina</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon salt </li>
            <li>2 cups warm water, or as needed</li>
            <li>1 quart oil for frying</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk masa harina and salt together; stir enough water into mixture until dough is smooth and holds together. Form dough into 2-inch balls. Flatten each ball to a 1/2-inch thick circle.</li>
            <li>Heat oil to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C) in a deep-fryer or large saucepan.</li>
            <li>Fry dough in the hot oil until sopes are just lightly browned, about 30 seconds per side. Remove sopes with tongs and place on a paper towel-lined plate; cool just until sopes can be handled. Pinch the edges of each sope together forming little 'boats'. Return to hot oil and fry until golden and cooked through, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
