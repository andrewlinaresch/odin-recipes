        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>This is a spicy sweet chipotle chicken dish that is served on tostadas</p>
        <h2>Ingridients: </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds bone-in chicken legs, breasts or a combination</li>
            <li> ½ medium white onion</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>2 small carrots, cut into 2-inch pieces</li>
            <li>¼ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>1 medium white onion, halved and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup canned crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>3 chipotles in adobo with sauce (1/3 cup)</li>
            <li>2 garlic cloves, peeled</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the chicken: Combine the chicken, onion, celery and carrots in a large saucepan and add 4 cups cold water. Add more water if needed to cover the solids. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Cook until the chicken is very tender and falling off the bones, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer the chicken to a bowl. When cool enough to handle, discard the skin and bones, then pull the meat into very fine shreds. Strain the broth and reserve for Tamales de Pollo or another use.</li>
            <li>While the chicken cooks, make the sauce: Heat the oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. While the onion cooks, puree the tomatoes, chipotles and garlic in a blender until smooth. Add to the pan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the chicken to the sauce and gently fold to evenly coat and heat through. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve immediately or cool to room temperature to use a filling for Tamales de Pollo.</li>
        </ol>
